## Login Credentials:  
```
phoneno: 6Ô∏è00061  
password: msuman   
```
(Check "Forgot Credentials". There's something interesting that I have implemented. Through this, I learnt to retrieve the system date.)


The home page (after login) has items (blank at present) that can be added to cart. Add to cart function implemented- can add multiple quantity of same product (counted as 1 product in cart). 

## Wallet Credentials:
